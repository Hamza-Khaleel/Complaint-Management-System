# Complaint-Management-System
>
Spring boot Api's for Complaint management system 
>
It is a project that was worked on at the request of the Palestinian Consumer 
Protection Association. We were asked to create a site that facilitates the 
association’s employees to deal with dispersed messages on social networking sites 
and facilitate the arrangement and scheduling of complaints, to make it easier for 
employees to serve consumers.
The consumer can complain about a company through a form on a mobile 
application, and he can provide the location of the place to the employee via GPS.
The employee can review this complaint and see the location of the company against 
which the complaint was made through a map that shows him its geographical 
location and verify the validity of the complaint.

Tools and Technology used: React (Admin, Employee sides), Flutter (for customer 
side), Spring boot with Postgres SQL to build the back and API’s necessary.
